Features:
• SSL
• Pluggable Authentication
• Connect timeout

Cleanup:
• Add conditions.
• Replace ASSERT with conditions.
• babel default encoding should come from mysql connection
  · Add our own encoding function that can look that up and call
    babel?
• Set client character-set on connect (default to :utf-8)
• Drop “mysql-” prefix from everything: this is a MySQL driver, so
   it's redundant.
• parse-foo → read-foo; encode-foo → write-foo
  · Make write-foo more like existing write-fns: (write thing stream)
• combine integers, strings → basic-types

Convenience
• Convenience functions for toggling bits in status and capability.
